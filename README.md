# Hey, Iâ€™m Jason ðŸ‘‹

I am an avid blockchain developer hacking on a few projects across gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. I am also a CS and Applied Math student at Vanderbilt University (on the side, I like to say ðŸ˜„).

## Aptos-Move Projects

I am currently focused on building dApps for the Aptos blockchain in Move, a novel smart contract programming language designed for secure digital assets. My current projects include:

### Aptos Arcade

[Aptos Arcade](https://www.aptosarcade.com/) is a web-based gaming platform that uses Aptos NFTs ([Pontem Pirates](https://www.topaz.so/collection/Pontem-Space-Pirates-c46dd298b8), [Aptos Monkeys](https://www.topaz.so/collection/Aptos-Monkeys-f932dcb983), etc.) as characters. Our flagship game, Aptos Arena, is a 2D fighter game similar to Super Smash, where each character has unique stats, skills, and weapons. A preview of the game is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odlw76LL2i0) and some of its repositories are open-source [here](https://github.com/aptos-arena). 

### Satay Finance

[Satay Finance](https://app.satay.finance/) is an all-in-one DeFi portfolio management tool offering three interconnected products:

1. **[Blocks](https://app.satay.finance/blocks)**Â - composable DeFi primitive operations through trusted third-party protocols
2. **[Strategies](https://app.satay.finance/products)**Â - compositions of Blocks that facilitate multi-protocol yield generation
3. **[Vaults](https://app.satay.finance/vaults)**Â - secure capital pools that optimize allocations to Blocks and Strategies to maximize yield

All of its source code, including the vault architecture, sample strategies, blocks, and partner interfaces are available on the [Satay GitHub organization](https://github.com/satay-protocol).

### Aptostream

[Aptostream](https://www.aptostream.com/) is a continuous payment streamer on Aptos allowing users to send and receive funds in real time. The contracts are deployed on Aptos Testnet, and I am looking to integrate them into Aptos Arcade to facilitate NFT rentals. The repositories are closed source, but the web app is live.
